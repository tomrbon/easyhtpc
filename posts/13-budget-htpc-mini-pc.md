Building a home theater PC used to mean spending $500-800 on a custom build. In 2026, mini PCs have changed the game entirely. For under $300, you can have a fully capable HTPC that streams 4K HDR, runs Plex, records TV, and serves as a general entertainment hub.

This guide walks you through every step: choosing the right mini PC, selecting accessories, installing software, and optimizing for living room use. All while staying under your $300 budget.

## Why Mini PCs Dominate Budget HTPC Builds

Traditional HTPC builds required:
- Mini-ITX case ($50-100)
- Low-profile CPU cooler ($30-50)
- Motherboard ($80-120)
- CPU ($100-200)
- RAM ($40)
- Storage ($40)
- Power supply ($50)

**Total**: $390-600 before you even add Windows.

Mini PCs bundle nearly everything into one box:
- Case, motherboard, CPU, and cooler: Included
- Power supply: External brick (included)
- Windows: Usually pre-installed
- RAM and storage: Often included on budget models

The savings are dramatic. And for HTPC use, performance is more than adequate.

## Step 2: Essential Accessories (Budget: $50-70)

### Remote Control Options

No HTPC is complete without proper control. Dump the keyboard and mouse.

**Option A: FLIRC USB + Harmony Remote (~$50 total)**

The FLIRC USB receiver lets you use any IR remote with your mini PC. It translates IR signals to keyboard commands that Kodi, Plex, and other apps recognize.

Setup:
1. Plug FLIRC into USB port
2. Download FLIRC software from flirc.tv
3. Walk through button mapping wizard
4. Done

This is the most flexible option. Use any old remote, or pair with a Logitech Harmony for true universal control.

**Option B: Bluetooth Remote (~$25-40)**

Many mini PCs include Bluetooth. A dedicated Bluetooth remote works well:

- WeChip G20 ($15-20): Basic, works well
- Minix A3 ($30): Includes air mouse
- Rii i8+ ($25): Mini keyboard + touchpad

**Option C: Smartphone App (Free)**

Kodi includes official remote apps:
- **Kore** (Android, official)
- **Official Kodi Remote** (iOS)
- **Yatse** (Android, advanced features)

The downside: your phone must be awake and on the same network. Not ideal for family use.

**Option D: HDMI-CEC (~$40)**

If your TV supports HDMI-CEC (most do), a CEC adapter lets your TV remote control Kodi directly. The Pulse-Eight adapter is the gold standard.

**Recommendation**: FLIRC USB ($22) + basic IR remote ($10-15) = ~$35 total

### HDMI Cable

Don't cheap out here. A bad cable causes intermittent issues that are maddening to diagnose.

**Requirements for 4K HDR:**
- Premium High Speed (18 Gbps) minimum
- Certified Ultra High Speed (48 Gbps) for future-proofing
- Length: 6 feet is ideal (signal degrades over distance)

**Price**: $10-15 for a quality 6-foot cable

### Storage Expansion (Optional)

If your mini PC has limited internal storage, external options help:

**USB 3.0 External SSD** ($30-50 for 500GB)
- Fast for media that needs random access
- No external power needed

**USB 3.0 External HDD** ($50-80 for 4TB)
- Best cost per GB
- Requires power adapter
- Slower seek times

**Budget option**: A 128GB USB flash drive ($15) for additional media storage.

### USB Hub (If Needed)

Mini PCs have limited USB ports. A powered hub adds capacity:

- 4-port USB 3.0 hub: $15-20
- 7-port USB 3.0 hub: $25-30

---

## Step 3: Software Installation

Your hardware is ready. Now install the software that makes it an HTPC.

### Option A: LibreELEC (Kodi-Focused)

**Best for: Dedicated Kodi players**

LibreELEC is a minimal Linux distribution designed solely to run Kodi. It boots in seconds, uses minimal resources, and updates automatically.

**Installation:**

1. Download LibreELEC from libreelec.tv
2. Flash to USB drive using Rufus (Windows) or Etcher (Mac/Linux)
3. Boot mini PC from USB (usually F7 or F12 at startup)
4. Follow installation wizard
5. System installs to internal drive
6. First boot takes 2-3 minutes for initialization

**Total time**: 15 minutes

**Pros:**
- Optimized for Kodi
- Boots in 10 seconds
- Auto-updates
- Free
- No Windows overhead

**Cons:**
- Kodi only (no other apps)
- Limited to Kodi add-ons for content

### Option B: Windows 11 (Multi-Purpose)

**Best for: Kodi + streaming apps + gaming**

Most mini PCs come with Windows 11 pre-installed. Keep it if you want access to Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming apps.

**Setup for HTPC use:**

```ini
# Step 1: Clean up Windows
1. Uninstall bloatware
2. Disable startup apps (Task Manager)
3. Set power plan to High Performance
4. Disable sleep: Settings → System → Power → Screen and sleep → Never

# Step 2: Install Kodi
1. Download from kodi.tv
2. Run installer
3. Configure display settings (see later section)

# Step 3: Install streaming apps
1. Microsoft Store has Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime
2. For apps not in Store, use web versions

# Step 4: Configure auto-start
1. Create shortcut to Kodi
2. Press Win+R, type "shell:startup"
3. Move shortcut to Startup folder
4. Kodi launches on login
```

**Windows optimizations for HTPC:**
- Set Kodi to launch on startup
- Configure Windows to auto-login (netplwiz)
- Disable Windows sounds (they're jarring on home theater)
- Set display scaling to 100%

**Total setup time**: 30-45 minutes

### Option C: CoreELEC (ARM-Only, Alternative)

If your mini PC has ARM processor (rare for x86 mini PCs), CoreELEC is an excellent alternative. Most readers will use x86 hardware, so LibreELEC is the better choice.

## Step 4: Configuration for Living Room Use

Software is installed. Now optimize for the living room environment.

### Display Settings

**Enable automatic refresh rate switching:**

This is critical for smooth playback. Videos should play at their native frame rate, not forced to 60Hz.

In Kodi:
```
Settings → Player → Videos
  - Adjust display refresh rate: "On start/stop"
  - Sync playback to display: ON
```

This prevents judder on 24fps movies.

**Enable HDR passthrough:**

If you have a 4K HDR TV:
```
Settings → Player → Videos
  - Allow HDR: ON
  
Settings → System → Display
  - Use 10-bit surfaces: ON
```

### Audio Configuration

**For surround sound receivers:**

```
Settings → System → Audio
  - Audio output device: HDMI (your receiver)
  - Speakers: 5.1 or 7.1 (match your setup)
  - Allow passthrough: ON
  - Check all formats your receiver supports
```

**For stereo TV speakers:**

```
Settings → System → Audio
  - Audio output device: HDMI (your TV)
  - Speakers: 2.0
  - Allow passthrough: OFF
```

**Test your audio:**

Play this test file in Kodi: [Dolby test files](https://www.dolby.com/technologies/dolby-atmos/demo-trailers/)

You should see your receiver display "Dolby Digital" or "TrueHD" when playing appropriate content.

### Remote Control Mapping

For FLIRC or keyboard controls, map essential functions:

| Function | Recommended Key |
|----------|-----------------|
| Navigation | Arrow keys |
| Select | Enter |
| Back | Backspace |
| Context menu | M or Menu |
| Play/Pause | Space |
| Stop | X |
| Skip forward | Page Down or → (held) |
| Skip backward | Page Up or ← (held) |
| Volume up | + or = |
| Volume down | - |
| Mute | F8 |

### Network Configuration

For streaming local media, wired Ethernet beats WiFi every time.

**Wired setup:**
1. Connect Ethernet cable
2. Most mini PCs auto-configure
3. Test speed: `iperf3 -c your.nas.ip`

**WiFi setup (if wired not possible):**
1. Use 5GHz band only
2. Position mini PC near router or use WiFi extender
3. Test actual throughput: should exceed 50Mbps for 4K content

**Network share setup:**

For NAS-stored media:
```ini
# Windows paths (add to Kodi sources)
\\NAS-IP\share\Movies
\\NAS-IP\share\TV Shows

# SMB paths (Linux/LibreELEC)
smb://NAS-IP/share/Movies
smb://NAS-IP/share/TV Shows
```
