## Introduction

Remember when cutting the cord meant choosing between Netflix and Hulu? Those days are long gone. In 2026, cord-cutting has evolved into a full-fledged entertainment revolution, with more options, better hardware, and bigger savings than ever before.
But here's the thing: the cable industry still rakes in billions from subscribers who haven't made the switch. Why? Because cutting the cord can feel overwhelming. Between streaming devices, subscription services, antennas, and privacy concerns, it's easy to see why some people stick with that $150 monthly cable bill out of sheer inertia.

That ends today.

**What you'll save:** The average American household pays $157 per month for cable television. A well-planned streaming setup costs $50-80 monthly, including internet. That's $900-1,200 back in your pocket annually.

## Free Streaming Services: The Hidden Gems

Before paying for anything, explore these completely free services. They're ad-supported but genuinely useful:

### Tubi

Owned by Fox, Tubi has the largest free library: over 50,000 movies and TV shows. You'll find older films, B-movies, and a surprising number of decent titles. No account required.

### Pluto TV

Pluto mimics cable TV with live channels and a grid guide. It's perfect for background viewing—news, sports highlights, reality TV, and classic movies. Over 250 live channels plus on-demand content.

### Amazon Freevee

Amazon's free service includes original content and a solid movie library. If you already have an Amazon account, it seamlessly integrates with Prime Video.

### Plex

Yes, Plex has a free streaming service with live TV channels and on-demand movies. If you're building a self-hosted media server, this is a nice bonus.

### The Roku Channel

Even without a Roku device, you can watch The Roku Channel on any device. Good selection of movies and some original content.

**Why free services matter**: These fill gaps between paid subscriptions. When you finish that Netflix series and don't know what to watch next, Tubi and Pluto have thousands of options at zero cost.

## Sports Without Cable

Sports used to be the #1 reason people stayed with cable. Not anymore. Here's how to watch every major sport in 2026:

### Football (NFL)

**Sunday Night Football**: Free on NBC (antenna)
**Monday Night Football**: ESPN (YouTube TV, Hulu Live, Sling Orange + Sports Extra)
**Thursday Night Football**: Amazon Prime Video
**NFL Sunday Ticket**: YouTube TV exclusively

**Pro tip**: If you only care about your local team, an antenna gets you most games for free. Sunday Ticket is only necessary for out-of-market games.

### Basketball (NBA)

**TNT games**: Sling Orange, YouTube TV, Hulu Live
**ESPN games**: Same options as above
**NBA League Pass**: $14.99/month for all out-of-market games
**Local games**: Bally Sports via DirecTV Stream (only option for many markets)

### Baseball (MLB)

**MLB.TV**: $149.99/year for out-of-market games
**ESPN games**: Any live TV streaming service
**Local games**: Regional sports networks (availability varies)

**MLB blackout trap**: Local games are blacked out on MLB.TV. If your team is the Yankees, you can't watch them on MLB.TV from New York. You need YES Network via cable or DirecTV Stream.

### Hockey (NHL)

**ESPN+/Hulu**: Many games exclusive to these platforms
**NHL.TV**: Out-of-market games
**TNT games**: Live TV streaming services

### Soccer

**ESPN+**: Champions League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A
**Peacock**: Premier League
**Paramount+**: Champions League, Serie A
**Fubo**: Best overall for soccer fans (beIN Sports, TUDN, ESPN)

**Fubo** deserves special mention—it started as a soccer streaming service and still offers the best soccer channel lineup.

## Step-by-Step: The Cord-Cutting Process

Ready to make the switch? Here's your action plan:

### Week 1: Assess Your Viewing

Before canceling, track what you actually watch:

1. **List your must-have channels**: Not 200 channels—the 10-15 you genuinely watch
2. **Check streaming availability**: Use a site like SupCompare.tv to see which services carry your channels
3. **Note your sports teams**: Determine which streaming services carry their games
4. **Count your TVs**: How many devices will you need?

### Week 2: Buy Hardware and Test Free Services

1. **Order your streaming device** (Shield Pro for power users, Fire TV Stick 4K Max for budget)
2. **Buy an antenna** (even a $20 indoor model works in most areas)
3. **Create accounts** for free services: Pluto TV, Tubi, Freevee, Plex
4. **Test your antenna placement**—scan for channels and find the sweet spot

### Week 3: Subscribe to Paid Services

1. **Start trials**: Most services offer 7-day trials. Stagger them so you can test thoroughly
2. **Test YouTube TV** (best overall cable replacement)
3. **Test alternatives**: Hulu + Live TV, Fubo, Sling
4. **Test on-demand**: Netflix, Max, Disney+ based on your content preferences

### Week 4: Cancel Cable and Optimize

1. **Call your cable company**: Be prepared for retention offers. If they offer a deal that beats your streaming costs, consider it
2. **Return your cable box** to avoid equipment fees
3. **Optimize your streaming subscriptions**: Cancel anything you don't use
4. **Set up a recurring calendar reminder** to review subscriptions monthly

### Ongoing: Manage and Adjust

Streaming is flexible—that's the point. Don't hesitate to:
- Switch services based on what you're watching
- Subscribe for a specific show, then cancel
- Try new services when they launch
- Rotate subscriptions (Netflix one month, Max the next)

## Hidden Costs to Watch For

Cutting the cord saves money, but watch for these expenses:

| Cost | Typical Price | How to Minimize |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Internet | $60-100/month | Negotiate with ISP, consider 5G home internet |
| Streaming devices | $50-200 each | One device per TV, but they last 5+ years |
| Subscriptions | $30-100+/month | Rotate services, cancel unused subscriptions |
| Antenna | $20-100 one-time | Start cheap, upgrade only if needed |
| VPN (optional) | $3-12/month | Only needed for privacy or geo-unblocking |

**Total typical cost**: $50-100/month including internet, versus $150+ for cable.

---

## The Bottom Line

Cutting the cord isn't just about saving money—it's about taking control of your entertainment. With the right streaming device, a mix of paid and free services, and a simple antenna, you'll have more content options than cable ever offered, at a fraction of the price.

Start with a quality streaming device, test the free services first, then add premium subscriptions based on what you actually watch. Your wallet will thank you.

## FAQ

**Do I need a smart TV to cut the cord?**
No. Any TV with an HDMI port works with a streaming device. In fact, a dedicated streaming device (Shield, Fire TV, Apple TV) is usually better than built-in smart TV apps, which get outdated quickly.

**Can I record shows like with a cable DVR?**
Yes. YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, and Fubo all include cloud DVR. For antenna TV, use a Tablo or HDHomeRun tuner to record over-the-air broadcasts.

**Will I miss out on local news?**
An antenna gives you local news for free. Most local stations also stream newscasts on their websites and apps. YouTube TV and other live TV services include local channels in most markets.

**What about internet data caps?**
Streaming uses a lot of data—roughly 3GB per hour for 4K content. If your ISP has a 1TB cap, you might hit it with heavy streaming. Consider unlimited data plans or switching to an ISP without caps (some fiber providers don't have them).

**Can I share my streaming subscriptions with family?**
Most services allow 2-6 simultaneous streams, making sharing possible. Netflix recently tightened sharing rules, but others remain lenient. Check each service's terms.

**What's the easiest way to cut the cord?**
Start simple: Get a Fire TV Stick 4K Max, subscribe to YouTube TV, and plug in an antenna. This covers 90% of what cable provides for half the cost. You can always customize later.

**Will cutting the cord affect my internet price?**
Some ISPs raise internet prices when you drop TV, but usually the total cost still decreases. Ask about internet-only pricing before canceling.
