## Why Mini PCs Are Perfect for Plex

Gone are the days when you needed a full tower PC for a media server. Modern mini PCs deliver:
- Intel QuickSync for hardware transcoding
- Low power consumption (15-25W vs 100W+ for full PCs)
- Silent operation
- Small footprint
For most home users, a mini PC beats traditional server builds. Here's what to buy.

## What to Look for in a Plex Mini PC

### CPU: Intel QuickSync Is Essential

For Plex transcoding, Intel's integrated graphics are unbeatable. AMD makes great processors but lacks QuickSync.

**Minimum for transcoding:**
- Intel Core i3 12th gen or newer
- Intel Core i5 8th gen or older

**Best options:**
- Intel Core i5 12th/13th gen
- Intel Core i7 11th/12th gen

### RAM: 8GB Minimum, 16GB Better

| Library Size | RAM Needed |
|--------------|------------|
| < 500 items | 8GB |
| 500-2000 items | 16GB |
| 2000-10000 items | 16-32GB |
| 10000+ items | 32GB+ |

RAM is easy to upgrade on most mini PCs—start with what ships and add more later.

### Storage: NVMe + External

Most mini PCs have:
- NVMe SSD slot (for OS and Plex database)
- Potential for 2.5" SATA SSD/HDD

**Recommended setup:**
- 500GB+ NVMe for OS and Plex
- External USB drives or NAS for media storage

### Network: Gigabit Minimum, 2.5GbE Preferred

Your network speed determines:
- How fast you can transfer media to the server
- Maximum bitrate for remote streaming

**Wait—AMD for Plex?**

This is the one exception to my "Intel only for transcoders" rule. Here's why:

The Beelink SER5 Pro is incredibly cheap. If you don't need transcoding (all your clients do direct play), the CPU is more than powerful enough.

## Comparison Table

| Mini PC | CPU | Transcoding | RAM Cap | Network | Price |
|---------|-----|-------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Intel NUC 13 Pro | Core i5-1340P | Excellent | 64GB | 2.5GbE | ~$450 |

## Storage Strategy

Mini PCs have limited internal storage. Here's how to handle media:

### Option 1: External Drives

Simple, cheap, but:
- Messy cables
- Drive letters change on reboot sometimes
- No redundancy

WD Elements 12TB - Good value external drive

### Option 2: DAS (Direct Attached Storage)

Multi-bay enclosure connected via USB or Thunderbolt:
- Cleaner than individual drives
- Can do RAID for redundancy
- Expensive

Orico 4-Bay DAS

### Option 3: NAS for Storage, Mini PC for Server

Best of both worlds:
- NAS handles storage with RAID protection
- Mini PC handles transcoding
- Connected via network

**Recommended**: Synology DS224+ [AFFILIATE] for storage, Intel NUC for server.

---

## Remote Access Considerations

### Plex Relay vs Direct Connect

**Plex Relay** (built-in):
- 1Mbps free, 2Mbps Plex Pass
- Works through any NAT
- Limited quality

**Direct connection**:
- Unrestricted bandwidth
- Requires port forwarding
- Exposes IP

### VPN for Privacy

Use VPN on your streaming devices to:
- Hide your home IP
- Encrypt traffic on public WiFi
- Access region-locked content

NordVPN or ExpressVPN

Or run VPN server on your mini PC for secure remote access.

## The Bottom Line

For most Plex users in 2026:

**Recommended setup:**
- **Intel NUC 13 Pro** (~$450) [AFFILIATE]
- **32GB RAM kit** (~$60) [AFFILIATE]
- **1TB NVMe SSD** (~$80) [AFFILIATE]
- **Synology DS224+ NAS** (~$300) for storage [AFFILIATE]

**Total**: ~$890 for a server that handles anything you throw at it.

**Budget setup:**
- **Beelink EQ12** (~$170) [AFFILIATE]
- **2x External 8TB drives** (~$320) [AFFILIATE]

**Total**: ~$490 for basic server needs.

## FAQ

**Do I need Plex Pass for mini PC transcoding?**
Yes. Hardware transcoding requires Plex Pass ($95 lifetime). Without it, your mini PC can still software transcode, but much less efficiently.

**Can I run other services on my Plex mini PC?**
Yes—this is one advantage over NAS. Run Sonarr, Radarr, Jackett, Home Assistant, Pi-hole, etc. Just ensure enough RAM.

**How much power does a mini PC use?**
Idle: 10-15W (like a night light)
Under load: 40-60W (much less than desktop PC)
At 15W idle: ~$15/year in electricity

**Do mini PCs overheat?**
Modern mini PCs are designed for compact cooling. Ensure good airflow, don't stack things on top, and you'll be fine.

**Can I upgrade parts later?**
Most mini PCs allow RAM and SSD upgrades. CPU and GPU are soldered. Check specs before buying.

*Small server, big library. That's the mini PC advantage.*
